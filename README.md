# Email_Spam_Predicitor

This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model that determines the probability any given email is spam mail or not. The project relies on techniques found in text mining practices and the use of the pandas, numpy and sklearn python libraries. The goal of the project is to build a generally reliable model as well as explore some of the key features and commonalities between spam mail samples to better understand the breadth (or lack thereof) of complexity and characteristics.

The process utilizes usual metrics and assumptions for its ML models and is designed to be exploratory in nature and is subject to constant improvements.
